In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-32 reading notes which included the following resources :
- [Intro to Serverless](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-serverless-architecture-what-are-its-pros-and-cons-cc4b804022e9)
- [AWS Amplify Kool-Aid](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)

## AWS Amplify 
***
AWS Amplify is a set of purpose-built tools and features that makes the developer able to use them directly without the need of knowing and implementing it all . 

**AWS Amplift Tools:**
- Amplify Studio
- Amplify Libraries
- Amplify CLI
- Amplify Hosting
- Add user authentication
- Build a powerful backend data model
- Visually build an app UI and backend
- Host a progressive web app or static website

Amplify automatically creates Amazon DynamoDB database tables for GraphQL types annotated with the `@model` directive in your GraphQL schema. You can create relations between the data models via the `@hasOne`,` @hasMany`, `@belongsTo`, and `@manyToMany` directives.
