# Class-08 : OO Design 
***

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-08 reading notes which included the following resources : 
- [Don’t Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- [Rule of Three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(computer_programming)).
- [You Aren’t Gonna Need It ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it).
- [Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

## Don’t Repeat Yourself

Don't repeat yourself - wikipedia   


The idea of **DRY** which refers to Don't Repeat Yourself is to use the code effectivly and not write the same code twice to avoid redundancy and wasting time , energy and complexity.  
But other programmers have other opinions like the **WET** which stands for write everything twice AKA write every time AKA we enjoy typing AKA waste everyone's time , who prefer to write the same thing multiple times like putting two lables on a button and so on.  
Another opinion is the **AHA** which stands for avoid hasty abstractions which doesn't prefer to neither write everything twice nor write it once , but to repeat the important things . In general AHA prefers to repetitive  code over wrong abstraction. 

## Rule of Three

Rule of three (computer programming) - wikipedia    

In simple words , rule of three aims to avoid code redndancy in order to reduce maintenance time if that code was written more than two times. Then it is preferred to refactor it out of the code and call it whenever you need it , that way maintenance time will be reduced a lot and calling time is super fast.

## Minimum Viable Product
***
MVP's approach is the the developers tend to make a market analysis then make a very basic product that can do enough to be usable and send it to users in order to take their feedback then respond to it by creating a new version of the product. That way developers can read if the product is successful or not and if it is worth to be developed or the market will not respond to it.
