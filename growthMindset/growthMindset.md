In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in growth mindset preperation task. I was requiered to :
- Read [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. ](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice)
- Watch [Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset.]()
- Watch [Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.]()
- Watch [Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.]() 

## Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice
***
In this article I learnt about *deliberate practice* which means the practice you do for practicing and improvement not for "playing".  
In order to do deliberate practice and improve your skills you have to learn something you didn't know before, and sure this doesn't come with practicing the same code every day.   
In order to learn something new it is recommended to have small hard tasks every day that forces ou to search and learn ,forces you to get out of your comfert zone. Errors forces you to search and if you couldn't find the answer ask someone else and have thier feedback on your project.

two set of exercises where metioned in the article and I found them interesting to get through :
- [The cryptopals crypto challenges](https://web.archive.org/web/20160620111206/http://cryptopals.com/)  
- [Rosalind](https://web.archive.org/web/20160607102654/http://rosalind.info/about/)

And keep in mind that **In this field you will get rewarded over every new skill and knowledge you learn.**

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
***
This video talked about school kids experincing growth mindset criterias and how they reacted and performed.
The idea is to set kids minds to accept different types of challenges and be aware that they can do it once they put effort in it, besided preventing them from thinking in a negative way like feeling as dumbs or failurs.
But HOW?  
Using the idea of **NOT YET** ! 
schoolers have certain number of exams that they shoud pass. In this exam if a student didn't pass the exam he is going to get "**NOT YET**" grade, which is going to give him the feeling that even if not now, he is going to pass it oneday. The power of YET word is very interesting and for me from now all I will say "Not Yet" for everything I didn't understand perfectly, because I will put effort into it to understand it and ask my TAs for help. 

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
***
In this video Angela Lee Duckworth talket about her experience in teaching in a public school and how her smartest kids were not performing as good as other kids, And how she kept thinking in what is the main factor for success . If not the IQ level,not safety feeling,not social intellegence than what?  
After her phsycological studies over students from different ages she went into a very interesting conclusion:  
**The key of success is simply GRIT!**  
How much passion you have to make your goals and dreams be true, how much you put effort on it and give it time is the key of your success.  
But how to make students get passionate and grit?
No one knows yet, but all we know that :
> **You have to be grit to make your kids grettier**

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success:
***
In this video I really liked a very important idea which is to ensure that the success we are looking and working to gain is what we want to what powerful forces are sending us into. Why would us want to win in a war that is not ours and won't give a benifit for us anyway?   
he also talked about other topics like how failure definition changed through time , in before times they were used to say about non-successful people unfortunates , which means that it is not from their doings , they were not given the fortunate to be successful. while nowadays they call them failures which makes it harder on them to believe that they can change it because it is from their acts. I really find it weird how our thought really get affected by our communities and other forces.
