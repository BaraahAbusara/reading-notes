# Practice In The Terminal

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in Practice in the Terminal preperation task. I was requiered to read :
- [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php) - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one.
- [Basic Navigation]() - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.
- [More About Files]() - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.
- [Manual Pages]() - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.
- [File Manipulation]() - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.
- [Cheat Sheet]() - A quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial.

## My notes (Tips) :
- In the terminal you can use arrows up and down to select a command from your history so you don't write it again. And you can edit it using right and left arrows.
- pwd is used to print working directory (path).
- cd which stands for change directory takes you to the file you specified , and if you didn't specify the location it will take you to your home or you can go home using `cd ~` , and you can use `cd ..` to take you a step out of where you are now.
- we have two types of paths : relative and Absolute .  
*Relative Path:*  a path that starts from the directory you are in.  
such as : `./Documents/testFile`.
*Absolute Path:* a path that starts from your home(root file system).  
such as :`/home/ryan/Documents`.
- The terminal provides us *Tab Completion* which means that if you type the first letter from a command then click tab it will auto complete it for you, and if there is more that one option it will stop then you can type tab again to see the options and pick one.
