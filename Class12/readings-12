# Class-12 : Spring RESTful Routing & Static Files 
***

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-12 reading notes which included the following resources : 
- [Spring guide: Accessing Data with JPA](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/).
- [Baeldung: Comparing repositories using JpaRepository](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-repositories).

## Spring guide: Accessing Data with JPA
***
This tutorial talks about implementing an application that stores objects inside a memory based database using the following steps :
- Starting with Spring Initializr.
- Define a Simple Entity.
- Create Simple Queries.
- Create an Application Class.
- Build an executable JAR that contains all the necessary dependencies, classes, and resources and run that using `./gradlew bootRun` and `./gradlew build` then run the JAR files using `java -jar build/libs/gs-accessing-data-jpa-0.1.0.jar` 



## Baeldung: Comparing repositories using JpaRepository
*** 
In this article, you will read about different kinds of Spring Data repository interfaces and their functionality.such as :

- **CrudRepository** that provides CRUD functions such as :
    - save(…)  
    - findOne(…)
    - findAll() 
    - count() 
    - delete(…) 
    - exists(…) 
- **PagingAndSortingRepository** that provides methods to do pagination and sort records and is inhirited from CrudRepository.
- **JpaRepository** that we used in [the previous tutorial](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/) and is inhirited from PagingAndSortingRepository and provides the following methods :
    - findAll() and findAll(...).
    - save(…) .
    - flush().
    - saveAndFlush(…) .
    - deleteInBatch(…).
