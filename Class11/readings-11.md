***

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-11 reading notes which included the following resources : 
- [Spring App Basics](https://spring.io/guides/gs/serving-web-content/).

>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprise Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popular in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.

## Spring App Basics

In this file you will find a guid to make your very first spring application project from scratch until you build an application that has a static home page and  will  accept HTTP GET requests at: `http://localhost:8080/greeting`.

It will respond with a web page that displays HTML. The body of the HTML will contain a greeting: “Hello, World!”
