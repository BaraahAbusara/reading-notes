# Class-10 : Stacks and Queues 
***

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-10 reading notes which included the following resources : 
- [Stacks and Queues](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html).

## Stack 
***
Stack is a data structrue that is made of group of nodes pointing to the next node only. 
Stack uses the idea of *First In Last Out **FILO*** which means that the first element enters the stack will be the last one to get out of it. 
Methods available for stacks :
- Push O(1) : it pushes the new node to the beginning of the stack. 
- Pop O(1) : it removes the first node of the stack. 
- Peek O(1) : it returns the value of the first element in the stack. 
- IsEmpty O(1) : it returns a boolean telling us if the stack is empty or not.

## Queue 
***
Queue is a data structrue that is made just like a queue on a counter who comes first will be served first *First In First Out **FIFO*** .

Methods available for queues :
- Enqueue O(1) : it pushes the new node to the end of the queue. 
- Dequeue O(1) : it removes the first node of the stack. 
- Peek O(1) : it returns the value of the first element in the queue. 
- IsEmpty O(1) : it returns a boolean telling us if the queue is empty or not.
