# Class-04 : Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
***

In this file I will be summarizing what I have learnt in class-04 reading notes which included the following resources : 
- [Java OO Tutorial (Objects and Classes)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/)
- [Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)
- [Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html)

## Java OO Tutorial :

### Objects:
an object is a space in memory that holds a description of something that has certain states(fields) and behaviours(methods) and has its own rules when it comes to who can access its fields and methods by *incapsolation* .
**Benifits of coding using Objects:** 
1. Using the code as modules and being able to control which module can be used where.
2. Privacy of data by making it private.
3. being able to re-use your code.
4. being able to debug the code easily.

### Classes:
Class in java is a blueprint of the object that describes a certain element using a constructor inside it , like if the ojbect was a car that has a model , color and speed and methods like setSpeed and getModel and setColor, the class is going to allow me to creat a new car saying that it has a model Audi , color red and a certain speed. 
If you want to add alot of cars from the same model that have certain properities beside being a car you can extract a *subclass* from car class as follows:
`public class Audi extends Car `  
that way your subclass will take or properities and methods from Car class , inhirit it and add its own methods and properities to it. 

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers :
***
**Decimal Numbers:** are normal numbers we use usually that is made from numbers from 0 to 9 which are 10 based and been built on like 19 which is actually built from 1 and 9.

**Binary Numbers:** which are numbers based to 2 and built from two digits 0 and 1 then you build other numbers from them like 11 which is 3 in Decimal numbers.


**Hexadecimal Numbers:**which consists of 10 numbers we know and extra 6 letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") after finishing them you start building up on them like 1F which is built from 1 and F.
