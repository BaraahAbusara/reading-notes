## Code of Ethics
### GENERAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES.
A computing professional should...
1. Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
2. Avoid all types of harm.
3. Be honest and trustworthy.
4.  Be fair and take action not to discriminate.
5. Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
6. Respect privacy.
7.  Honor confidentiality.

### PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
A computing professional should...
1. Strive to achieve high quality in both the processes and products of professional work.
2. Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice.
3. Know and respect existing rules pertaining to professional work.
4. Accept and provide appropriate professional review.
5. Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
6. Perform work only in areas of competence.
7. Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled by the public good.
8. Foster public awareness and understanding of computing, related technologies, and their consequences.
9. Design and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure.

### PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PRINCIPLES.
A computing professional, especially one acting as a leader, should...
1. Ensure that the public good is the central concern during all professional computing work.
2. Articulate, encourage acceptance of, and evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities by members of the organization or group.
3. Manage personnel and resources to enhance the quality of working life.
4. Articulate, apply, and support policies and processes that reflect the principles of the Code.
5. Create opportunities for members of the organization or group to grow as professionals.
6. Use care when modifying or retiring systems.
7. Recognize and take special care of systems that become integrated into the infrastructure of society.

### COMPLIANCE WITH THE CODE.
A computing professional should...
1. Uphold, promote, and respect the principles of the Code.
2. Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.


## Software Engineering Code of Ethics

Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
1.  Software engineers shall act consistently with the **public** interest.
2. Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their **client and employer** consistent with the public interest.
3. Software engineers shall ensure that their **products** and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional **judgment**.
5. Software engineering **managers** and **leaders** shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the **management** of software development and maintenance.
6. Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the **profession** consistent with the public interest.
7. Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their **colleagues**.
8. **SELF** - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

## Ethics in the workplace : The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of 

This blog talks about a young developer that happened in his life to build a project that had a hidden goal which pushes a certain drug into the market targetting young girls ,and later on he discovered the side effects of that drug which was the reason of a young girl killing herself. 
He felt hame building that project because it is legal but not actually ethical just for money .  
> The more software continues to take over every aspect of our lives, the more important it will be for us to take a stand and ensure that our ethics are ever-present in our code.

As developers,now adays ,we are considered the last lines of defense against potentially dangerous and unethical practices.

So please , as the author is doing now , **think twice about the effects of your code before u write it.**


## Ethics in Technology : The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars  

The questions this article is raising are :  
**"Could cybercriminals remotely hijack an autonomous car's electronics with the intent to cause a crash? Could terrorists commandeer the vehicles as weapons? Could data stored onboard be unlocked?**

Experts say that self-driving cars will be particularly susceptible to hackers. What makes them so vulnerable.
If the car works with any outside services like internet or outside sensors then yes, it might be susceptible to hackers.

**Would you feel safe in a self-driving car?**

The answer is simply NO , We do not really have self-driving cars yet. Rather, we have semi-automated self-driving cars.


## Tech Company Principles : AI at Google: our principles

### Objectives for AI applications :
We believe that AI should: 
1. Be socially beneficial. 
2. Avoid creating or reinforcing unfair bias.
3. Be built and tested for safety.
4. Be accountable to people.
5. Incorporate privacy design principles.
6. Uphold high standards of scientific excellence.
7. Be made available for uses that accord with these principles.  

## AI applications we will not pursue

In addition to the above objectives, we will not design or deploy AI in the following application areas:


1. Technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.  Where there is a material risk of harm, we will proceed only where we believe that the benefits substantially outweigh the risks, and will incorporate appropriate safety constraints.

2. Weapons or other technologies whose principal purpose or implementation is to cause or directly facilitate injury to people.

3. Technologies that gather or use information for surveillance violating internationally accepted norms.
